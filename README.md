# School-Notes

A GitHub Repo to contain all of my school notes from obsidian and other note taking apps. 
Each folder will be for a different school / project and all notes will be backed up on here from
my pc.

Some stuff may not look right, sine Obsidian uses LaTex and MathJax to show equations, so try to 
discern what the equation should be from the context.
