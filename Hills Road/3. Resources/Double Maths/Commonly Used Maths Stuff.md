## Sine, Cosine And Tan

#### Sine, Cosine + Tan relations
If there is an angle `θ` (*theta*), then the following are true:
$$tanθ = \frac{sinθ}{cosθ}$$
$$cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ = 1$$

This can be linked to the unit circle:

Where the *X*-Axis is `cosθ` and the *Y*-Axis is `sinθ`. The hypotenuse of the triangle that these two lines make is always equal to one. Thus, $cos^2θ + sin^2θ = 1$, always. `tanθ` on the other hand is equal to the intersection between `y = 1` and the line created if the line from `(0,0)` to the point `(cosθ, sinθ)` were to be extended.

#### Sine Rule
The sine rule is important since it can be used to figure out either the size of an angle or the length of any triangle's side, given the right information.

The rule goes as follows: $$\frac{sinA}{a}  =  \frac{sinB}{b}  =  \frac{sinC} {c}$$, where each smaller case letter is the opposite side to the angle *(upper case letter)*.

#### Cosine Rule
The cosine rule can also be used to find angles and sides lengths in a triangle. 

The rule is: $$cosA = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / 2bc$$, where `a`, `b` and `c` are all the sides of the triangle.

#### Soh Cah Toa
Sine, Cosine and Tan can all be used to find out angles and sides of a right angle triangle.

The phrase `Soh Cah Toa` refers to the separate functions which link the sides of the triangle to an angle.
**
`Soh => sinθ = opposite side / hypoteneuse`
`Cah => cosθ = adjacent side / hypotteneuse`
`Toa => tanθ = opposite side / adjacent side`

## Binomial Expansion
"N Choose R"
The function is as follow : $$\frac{n!}{r! * (n - r)!}$$

This function can also be used to generate the numbers inside of *Pascal's Triangle*.

## Pythagoras' theorem

**NOTE: Pythagora's theorem only applies to right-angle triangles**

The theorem is as follows: $h^2 = a^2 + b^2$
