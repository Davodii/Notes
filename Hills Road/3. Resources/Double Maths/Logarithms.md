# Logarithms

## What is 'log'
The mathematical function `log` can be used to find the power of a base. The general structure of the `log` function is : $log_a(b) = c$, where `a` is the base, or the number which has the power. The `b` is the result of `a^c` and `c` is the power of the base.

## The laws of log
There are 3 laws of logarithms and they can be used to solve equations that use `log`. They are:
$$log_a(x * y) = log_a(x) + log_a(y)$$
$$log_a( \frac{x}{y}) = log_a(x) - log_a(y)$$
$$log_a(x^b) = b * log_a(x)$$

There are more laws of `log` but these are the most important.
