# Forces
The branch of physics that deals with forces in equilibrium is known as statics.

Forces are vector quantities and is measured in Newtons. They are can be represented by an arrow on a diagram.

See [[Physics Need To Know#Vectors]] to help with forces and their components.

## Weight
An object's weight is calculated by its mass x gravitational force g.
Gravitational field strength is measured in Newtons per kilogram.

## Contact Force
When two solid surfaces touch, they both exert a contact force on each other.

It prevents objects from going through each other.

If the two forces are pushed closer together, the contact force will increase. The resultant force between the surfaces is the sum of all interatomic repulsions.

## Surface friction 
When two objects are in relative motion and collide, the frictional force is a resistive force that opposes the sliding of the two objects.

Surfaces will not slide across each other unless and external force breaks the electromagnetic forces acting on the objects.

The force due to friction is proportional to the normal contact force.
The constant is known as the coefficient of friction.
$$Force (N) = \micro N$$
Where $\micro$ is the coefficient of friction, and its size depends on the nature (roughness) of the surfaces.

## Tension
An object is in tension when the forces acting on it try to stretch / pull the object apart.

When dealing with questions, we can assume that the tension is consistent throughout the object, as long as the weight of the object is small compared to the tension.

## Upthrust, Lift and Drag
### Upthrust
Upthrust (or buoyancy) is the force that makes a boat or hot air balloon float, on their respective fluids. It occurs due to the difference in pressure at different heights acting on the object.

At any point in a fluid, the pressure acts isotropically (same in all directions). Pressure is defined as:
$$P = \frac{F}{A}$$
Where `P` is pressure measured in `N m^2`, `F` is measured in `N` and `A` is the area measure in `m^2`.

#### Archimedes' Principle
Archimedes' Principle states that:
```The uptrhust on an object in a fluid is equal to the weight of fluid displaced by the object.```

### Lift
When in air, the upward force experienced by objects such as planes is called lift. It results due to the object moving at speed through the air.

In A-level physics, it can just be described as a vertical force acting on the object.

### Drag
Drag (or water / resistance) is similar to friction, but it is a resistive force between an object and the fluid through which it's moving, therefore drag is always in the opposite direction from which the object is moving.
