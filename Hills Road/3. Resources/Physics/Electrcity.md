# Electricity

## Current, Voltage and Resistance
What is:
- **Current**: the rate at which electron in a conductor flow past a point in an electrical circuit
- **Voltage**: voltage or potential difference (p.d) is the difference in electrical potential between two points, energy per unit charge given up by charges as they pass through a device
- **Resistance**: a measure of the opposition to current in an electrical circuit, each conductor in a circuit has resistance

## Important Equations:
Current (`I`) in `Amps`
Voltage (`V`) in `Volts`
Resistance (`R`) in `Ohms`
Power (`P`) in `Watts`
Energy / Work Done (`E`) in `Joules`
Charge (`Q`) in `Coulombs` 
Time (`t`) in `Seconds`
 
```
I = Q / t 
V = I * R
E = V * Q
P = E / t
P = V * I
```

## Kirchoff's Laws
 - **Kirchhoff's current law** (1st Law) states that the current flowing into a node (or a junction) must be equal to the current flowing out of it. This is a consequence of charge conservation.

 - **Kirchhoff's voltage law** (2nd Law) states that in any complete loop within a circuit, the sum of all voltages across components which supply electrical energy (such as cells or generators) must equal the sum of all voltages across the other components in the same loop. This law is a consequence of both charge conservation and the conservation of energy.

## Resistance
Resistance is caused when electron collide with other parts of conductors, such as impurities and the metal ions. When a collision occurs, some energy is lost since it is absorbed by the ion. 

#### Resistance in Series
The total resistance in a series is circuit is the sum of all resistances in the circuit.
`Rt = R1 + R2 + .... Rn`

#### Resistance in Parallel
The total resistance of a circuit in parallel is the potential difference divided by total current.
`1 / Rt = 1 / R1 + 1/R2 + .... 1 / Rn`
