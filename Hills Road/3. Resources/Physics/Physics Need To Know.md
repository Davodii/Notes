## Vectors
Vectors are units which include both magnitude and direction. Some of these include : `Force (N), Velocity (ms^-1), Displacement` etc.

#### Resolving Vectors to their components
Most often when asked a question about resolving a vector, the exam board will provide the vector and in which way it is acting, e.g `10N at 30° North of East`. 

To resolve a vector means splitting it into its horizontal and vertical components. This can be done using [[Commonly Used Maths Stuff#Soh Cah Toa]] to determine to needed vectors.

#### Adding Vectors
The most common method of adding vectors is by using the `head to tail` method where each vector is added onto the end of the previous vector beginning with a start point (the object) and ends at a certain point. The line between the object and the final point will be the resulting vector of the object's total vectors.

## Measurements and their Errors

#### Types of measurements
There are two ways types of values in physics: `readings` and `measurements`.

`Readings` -> values found from single judgment when using a piece of equipment. E.g measuring the temperature using a thermometer.

`Measurement` -> values taken as a difference between the judgments of two values. E.g using a ruler to measure the length of an object.

#### Uncertainties
Both `reading` and `measurement` values have uncertainties which need to be written down and understood to show how errors could have affected your results.

`Reading uncertainty` -> +/- half of the smallest division (Resolution) of the instrument.
 
`Measurement uncertainty` -> +/ half of the smallest division (Resolution) for each reading


#### Errors
There are two common types of errors: `Random error` and `Systematic error`.

`Random errors`:
 - Are caused by factors that change between measurements
 - readings unpredictably fluctuate
 - These include :
	 - Environmental changes
	 - observation / reading uncertainties
 - repeat readings and average out results to minimize effect of these errors

`Systematic errors`:
 - consistent difference between measured and true values
 - These include:
	 - calibration error
	 - parallax error
	 - zero error
	 - poor experimental design
 - they can be identified by drawing a graph of the results

#### Accuracy V Precision
`Accuracy` and `precision` are both very different things.

`Accuracy` -> how close the results are to their true value

`Precision` -> how close together different results are to each other

#### Absolute and Percentage Uncertainty
`Absolute uncertainty (Δ)` refers to the unit value of uncertainty. For example and the absolute uncertainty of a measurement could be `+/ 0.3 g` where `+/-` refers to the uncertainty.

`Percentage uncertainty (ε)` refers to uncertainty being expressed as percentage of the measured value. For example `+/- 2.5%` is what percentage uncertainty looks like.

**NOTE: Absolute uncertainties should always be written to 1 significant figure**
