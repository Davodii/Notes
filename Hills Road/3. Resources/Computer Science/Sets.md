# Number Sets
## N Set
The set N is a set defined as a set of all positive integers (natural numbers). The set of numbers N can be defined as :  `N = {0, 1, 2, ...}`. This is the first and the most common set of numbers.

## Z Set
The set Z is a set defined as a set of all positive and negative integers (or just integers). The set can be defined as : `Z = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}`.

## Q Set
The set Q contains all integers as well as all rational numbers (numbers which can be written as a fraction). The set can be defined as `Q = {..., -1, ..., -1/2, ..., 0, ..., 1/3, ..., 1, ...}`.

## R Set
The set R contains all numbers; integers, rational and irrational, making it the set of all real numbers. The set is an extension of all previous sets yet contains numbers such as `root 2` and `PI`.
