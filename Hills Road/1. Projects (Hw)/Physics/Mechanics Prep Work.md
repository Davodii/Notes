## Scalars and Vectors

Scalar measurements only record magnitude. For example, scalar measurements include, but are not limited to :
 - Distance
 - Mass
 - Height / length
 - Time
 - Speed

Vector values not only include magnitude but also direction. These include:
 - Displacement
 - Velocity
 - Momentum
 - Force
 - Acceleration 

## Displacement vs Distance
Distance - Scalar, physical distance between two points
Displacement - Vector, relative distance between two points, e.g walking in a circle will have a displacement of `0`.

`Velocity = displacement / time`

## Adding Vectors
When adding vectors, create a triangle (there can be multiple vectors which create other polygons but triangles are the most common). You can then use [[Regular Functions#Pythagoras' theorem]] to calculate the resultant vector. 
In questions that ask for drawing the diagram, the vectors should first be turned to a relative value, e.g `1500N` -> `2.5cm` where `1cm` represents `600N`.

## Subtracting Vectors
When Subtracting vectors, the most typical questions one is asked have to do with Forces. In any case, any similar vectors should be grouped together, e.g `300N` drag and `150N` Air resistance both counteract thrust and so add up to `450N` of Force.

The groups of vectors can then be subtracted out to leave a value. 

In cases where the vectors are not exactly opposite, a polygon can again be used to calculate the resultant vector.

## Resultant Vectors
To resolve a vector means to break up a vector into its `X` and `Y` components.

This can be done using [[Regular Functions#Pythagoras' theorem]] to calculate the other sides using angle `Î¸`
and the hypotenuse (vector).
